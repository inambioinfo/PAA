This exemplary "20 Alzheimer's disease serum samples vs. 20 controls" data set is a subset of a publicly available ProtoArray data set.
It can be downloaded from the repository "Gene Expression Omnibus" (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
Search for the GEO record "GSE29676". It has been contributed by Nagele E et al..

2. Dummy data
Based on this data set a very small raw (i.e., gpr files) dummy data set (file names tagged with "dummy_") has been created
by massive data reduction in order to enable the demostration of the function loadGPR() in PAA's man pages and its vignette.
Additionally, this dummy data has been saved in the file "DummyData.RData".



3. Results
In the files "selectFeaturesResultsEns.RData" and "selectFeaturesResultsFreq.RData" exemplary feature selection results for the Alzheimer's
disease data (see section 1) are stored.
