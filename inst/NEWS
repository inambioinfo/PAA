RELEASE HISTORY OF THE "PAA" PACKAGE
===========================================

CHANGES IN PAA VERSION 1.7.1 [2016-05-13]:
-----------------------------------------------
GENERAL
* Built with the latest R version (R-3.2.4 Revised).
* Built with the latest Rtools version (Rtools 3.3).
* Update of the PAA citation: PAA applications note, Turewicz et al.,
  Bioinformatics, 2016, PMID: 26803161, added to the CITATION
  file.
* Update of the URL in the DESCTIPTION file.
* Correction of some typos in the documentation.
* Update of the vignette to demonstrate the new features.

NEW FEATURES
* New function: batchFilter.anova() for multi-batch scenarios.
* New function: plotFeaturesHeatmap.2() as an alternative to
  plotFeaturesHeatmap().
* New arguments for loadGPR(): "description", "description.features"
  and "description.discard" for data import when gpr files don't
  provide the column "Description". Furthermore, new dummy data
  has been added to the package in order to demonstrate this
  new feature.
* Now the customized object classes EListRaw and EList contain the
  new component "array.type" added by loadGPR when the data is
  imported.

IMPROVEMENTS
* Additional and more informative error messages added.
* The function plotArray() is more flexible. Now, not only
  ProtoArrays can be plotted. Moreover, now the plot can be saved
  also as png file.


MODIFICATIONS
* The loadGPR() and plotArray()-argument "protoarray.aggregation" has
  been renamed to "aggregation" and the default value has been
  changed to "none".
* The loadGPR() argument "array.type" is mandatory now.

BUG FIXES
* Plots created during rlm normalization by normalizeArrays() were in
  logE scale and not in log2 scale. This has been fixed.
* Correction of regular expressions for rlm normalization in
  normalizeArrays() and for data import in loadGPR().

CHANGES IN PAA VERSION 1.5.1 [2015-10-20]:
-----------------------------------------------
GENERAL
* No changes.

NEW FEATURES
* The new function plotArray() is available. It can be used for visual inspection of
  ProtoArrays as well as for the monitoring of the impact of any pre-processing method
  applied to the data. In order to support the plotting of ProtoArrays before duplicate
  aggregation and to mimic the original scan image of ProtoArrays, now loadGPR() supports
  the option protoarray.aggregation="none". Finally, the vignette has been updated in
  order to describe the new function via an exemplary ProtoArray showing a spatial bias.

IMPROVEMENTS
* No changes.

MODIFICATIONS
* No changes.

BUG FIXES
* Since the exemplary data have been imported with the bug which has been fixed in PAA
  version 1.3.3, all exemplary data sets have been reimported with the latest version of
  loadGPR() and saved as RData files. Now all exemplary data sets are complete.

CHANGES IN PAA VERSION 1.3.3 [2015-07-14]:
-----------------------------------------------
GENERAL
* No changes.

NEW FEATURES
* No changes.

IMPROVEMENTS
* No changes.

MODIFICATIONS
* No changes.

BUG FIXES
* Bug in the function loadGPR() fixed (due to a wrong regular expression some data rows
  were not imported from gpr files in PAA versions 1.3.2 and 1.3.1 -> the bug was not
  relevant for the versions 1.3.0 and older).

CHANGES IN PAA VERSION 1.3.2 [2015-06-22]:
-----------------------------------------------
GENERAL
* Update to the latest R version which has been released a few days ago (2015-06-18).
* Built with R-3.2.1

NEW FEATURES
* No changes.

IMPROVEMENTS
* No changes.

MODIFICATIONS
* NEWS file of version 1.3.1 corrected (wrong version number for the last update in the
  NEWS file).

BUG FIXES
* No changes.

CHANGES IN PAA VERSION 1.3.1 [2015-06-17]:
-----------------------------------------------
GENERAL
* The optional rlm normalization (for ProtoArrays) used by the functions normalizeArrays(),
  plotNormMethods() and plotMAPlots() has been completely reimplemented in order to fix
  some bugs and simplify the usage of these functions (details: see below).
* Built with R-3.2.0 

NEW FEATURES
* No changes.

IMPROVEMENTS
* Due to the modification of the EListRaw objects for ProtoArrays the usage of the
  functions normalizeArrays(), plotNormMethods() and plotMAPlots() is simplified since
  some obsolete arguments have been removed (see 'MODIFICATIONS'). Esp., the provision of
  a second controls-specific EListRaw object for controls data and information was too
  complex and has confused some users. Now all control spot-specific data and information
  are stored together with probe-specific data and information in one extended EListRaw
  object.

MODIFICATIONS
* On the one hand, the arguments 'controls.elist', 'gpr.path', 'targets.path' and
  'contr.names' have been removed from the functions normalizeArrays(), plotNormMethods()
  and plotMAPlots(). On the other hand, the argument 'controls' has been added to the
  functions normalizeArrays(), plotNormMethods() and plotMAPlots().

BUG FIXES
* Due to the re-implementation of the optional rlm normalization (for ProtoArrays)
  used by the functions normalizeArrays(), plotNormMethods(), plotMAPlots(), all bugs
  that have been reported by users since version 1.0.0 are fixed.

BUG FIXES
* Bug in the function batchAdjust() removed.
  Because the argument "mod" was not passed as factor to sva's
  function ComBat() errors were thrown and execution stopped
  for the latest versions of sva. This has been corrected.
