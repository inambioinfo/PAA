RELEASE HISTORY OF THE "PAA" PACKAGE
===========================================

CHANGES IN PAA VERSION 1.2.1 [2015-06-17]:
-----------------------------------------------
GENERAL
* The optional rlm normalization (for ProtoArrays) used by the functions normalizeArrays(),
  plotNormMethods() and plotMAPlots() has been completely reimplemented in order to fix
  some bugs and simplify the usage of these functions (details: see below).
* Built with R-3.2.0 

NEW FEATURES
* No changes.

IMPROVEMENTS
* Due to the modification of the EListRaw objects for ProtoArrays the usage of the
  functions normalizeArrays(), plotNormMethods() and plotMAPlots() is simplified since
  some obsolete arguments have been removed (see 'MODIFICATIONS'). Esp., the provision of
  a second controls-specific EListRaw object for controls data and information was too
  complex and has confused some users. Now all control spot-specific data and information
  are stored together with probe-specific data and information in one extended EListRaw
  object.

MODIFICATIONS
* On the one hand, the arguments 'controls.elist', 'gpr.path', 'targets.path' and
  'contr.names' have been removed from the functions normalizeArrays(), plotNormMethods()
  and plotMAPlots(). On the other hand, the argument 'controls' has been added to the
  functions normalizeArrays(), plotNormMethods() and plotMAPlots().

BUG FIXES
* Due to the re-implementation of the optional rlm normalization (for ProtoArrays)
  used by the functions normalizeArrays(), plotNormMethods(), plotMAPlots(), all bugs
  that have been reported by users since version 1.0.0 are fixed.

  for the latest versions of sva. This has been corrected.
