Description: PAA imports single color (protein) microarray data that has been saved in gpr 
             file format - esp. ProtoArray data. After pre-processing (background correction, 
             batch filtering, normalization) univariate feature pre-selection is performed 
             (e.g., using the "minimum M statistic" approach - hereinafter referred to as "mMs"). 
             Subsequently, a multivariate feature selection is conducted to discover biomarker 
             candidates. Therefore, either a frequency-based backwards elimination aproach or 
             ensemble feature selection can be used. PAA provides a complete toolbox of analysis 
             tools including several different plots for results examination and evaluation.
